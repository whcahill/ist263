    </head>
    <body>
    My name is William Cahill. I’m studying TV radio and film as well as information management and technology and I’m interested in working as an editor or producer in film or TV production. I’m currently the head of content creation for OTN’s late night comedy show Live From Studio B and an assistant editor for Gettin’ to the Point, an online interview show hosted by Syracuse student, David Levine. In my spare time I like to go snowboarding or hiking when I have friends or family members to come with me. When I’m on my own I like playing video games like Hollow Knight and Doom or watching movies like Arrival and Blade Runner.
