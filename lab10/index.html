            <p>
                    I was born and raised in the small town of Florham Park New Jersey. I attended Hanover Park Highschool and I was a member of the varisty soccer team and the captain of the mock trial varsity tennis teams. Currently I'm a student at Syracuse University.
                <br>
                    I’m studying TV radio and film as well as information management and technology and I’m interested in working as an editor or producer in film or TV production. I’m currently the head of content creation for OTN’s late night comedy show <strong>Live From Studio B</strong> and an assistant editor for <strong>Gettin’ to the Point</strong>, an online interview show hosted by Syracuse student, David Levine.

            <h3> Personal Info </h3> In my spare time I like to go snowboarding or hiking when I have friends or family members to come with me. When I’m on my own I like playing video games like Hollow Knight and Doom or watching movies. Here are some of my favorites:
