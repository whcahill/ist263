                    We’re a student run production club, currently producing our 9th season of interviews, games, sketches, musical numbers, story times, monologues, and more!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our show was first pitched by Lizzie Michael and Josh Feinblatt in 2016 and since then we’ve grown into a well oiled machine of writers, graphic designers, content creators, crew members, and social media managers. Over 80 students contribute to making a half hour of content every other week and we couldn’t be more proud of what we do.
